# Room-Landing-Page
Room Landing Page with GSAP animations

Live Site: https://jonkohjj.github.io/Room-Landing-Page/

This was done with pure HTML, SCSS and JS and GSAP library. 

Design taken from https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/room-homepage-BtdBY_ENq and then built sequentially.

Concepts learnt:
1. javascript logic for the carousell (changing of slides and contents beside)
2. javascript for responsive nav bar
3. gsap javascript for all animations
4. overall layout with images
