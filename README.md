# Room-Landing-Page
This is a solution to the [Room homepage challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/room-homepage-BtdBY_ENq).

Users can:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://jonkohjj.github.io/Room-Landing-Page/](https://jonkohjj.github.io/Room-Landing-Page/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) - JS library

### What I learned

1. javascript logic for the carousell (changing of slides and side content)
3. gsap javascript for all animations
4. overall layout with images

### Continued development

Integrate animation when slide changes and adding more pages and functionalities to make it a multi-page web application.
